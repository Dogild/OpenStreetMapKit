# OpenStreetMapKit

## Introduction

OpenStreetMapKit is a Cappuccino Framework to manipulate maps right from Cappuccino.
It adds a layer on the top the native OSM view, that allows you to add real CPView at given coordinates transparently.
It also has a cool feature that will automatically groups markers if there are too many of them in the same zone (a la Google Earth)

Coming very soon :)
